<h1>About me!</h1>
<p>Hello everyone, I am Apurva from India. My summer breaks are going on and I always wanted to explore the computer science field as my major is mathematics and one of friend suggested me this web development course from Doctor Angela Yu. I like this course very much because Dr. Angela has made it so easy for me to learn this course as I am someone from non-cs background.</p>
<p>Yesterday one of my friend called me and asked me if I am learning and additional skills during this break and I told her about this course. After I told her the way you teach, she became eager to try this web development course of yours and I provided her with my id and password.</p>
<p>Thank you Dr. Angela<br/>
    Yours faithfully<br/>
    Apurva
